<p class="title">Tetris is Turing-complete</p>  
<p>This article presents a method for embedding a programmable, general-purpose, digital computer into Tetris. The capabilities and performance of an implementation are demonstrated by running Tetris on Tetris.</p>

<h1 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h1>

<p>The <span class="term">playfield</span> is the grid of square cells where Tetris is played. The standard playfield has 20 visible rows and 10 columns, but the dimensions are arbitrary.</p>

<object data="standard-playfield.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Standard Playfield</object>

<p>Each playfield cell is in one of two states: empty or solid.</p>

<p><span class="term">Tetriminos</span>&mdash;the falling pieces&mdash;consist four solid cells painted any color. The seven Tetriminos have single-character, shape-based names.</p>

<object data="seven-tetriminos.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Seven Tetriminos</object>

<p>A <span class="term">rotation</span> system describes how Tetriminos rotate in relation to the surrounding cells and the playfield boundaries. The method employees the right-handed <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Nintendo_Rotation_System" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nintendo Rotation System</a> (NRS) due to its simplicity, but <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Category:Rotation_systems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">various rotation systems</a> exist and any of them could be adapted.</p>

<p>NRS centers each Tetrimino in a 5&times;5 matrix and rotates them 90&deg; about that center. Of the 24 possible orientations, it uses only 19.</p>

<object data="orientation-table.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Orientation Table</object>

<p>The left-most column comprises the spawn orientations (the way the pieces initially appear). The steps of clockwise rotation span left-to-right.</p>

<p>The mnemonics above each orientation consist of the piece type concatenated with the first letter of &ldquo;down&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo;, &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;, &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;, or nothing for O.</p>

<p>A <span class="term">move</span> is a 90&deg; rotation or a 1-cell translation of the piece in play. The following terms apply to translation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <span class="term">shift</span> is a horizontal translation.</li>
    <li>A <span class="term">drop</span> is a downward translation.
        <ul>
            <li>A <span class="term">soft drop</span> is a player-controlled, 1-cell drop.</li>
            <li>A <span class="term">hard drop</span> is a meta-move that forces the piece as far down as it can go and <span class="term">locks</span> it into place. It is operationally-equivalent to repeated soft drops.</li>
            <li>A <span class="term">gravity drop</span> is an automatic, 1-cell drop triggered by the <span class="term">fall timer</span>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A move is preceded by a <span class="term">request to move</span>. Per NRS, the request is granted iff all four cells of the transformed Tetrimino are empty and are within the bounds of the playfield. If the fall timer’s request for a gravity drop is denied, the piece locks and the next piece spawns.</p>

<p>Spawning involves a <span class="term">randomizer</span>, the mechanism that determines the sequence of pieces presented to the player. Any randomizer guaranteed to eventually produce all seven Tetriminos from any point in the sequence will work with the method.</p>

<h1 id="method-overview">Method Overview</h1>

<p>On an infinite playfield&mdash;bounded only by the floor&mdash;an input data set is encoded into the cells of the bottom-2 rows. Tetriminos are dropped onto those cells, forming a structure logically-equivalent to a Boolean circuit. From the top-2 rows of that structure, an output data set is decoded.</p>

<object data="boolean-circuit.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Boolean Circuit</object>

<p>The output rows serve as input rows of a structure built above it and the process can be repeated indefinitely. The effect is a state machine where the data rows are states and the structures are transition functions.</p>

<object data="state-machine.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">State Machine</object>

<p>A construction exists where the data capacity of a state always exceeds its predecessor. It is a means of building an abstract computing device with unbounded storage, a.k.a. a Turing machine.</p>

<h1 id="blindfolded-player">The Blindfolded Player</h1>

<p>Tetris requires a player. But if the player can see the playfield, then constructing a Turing machine is trivial. A sighted player can read input data, perform calculations via any mechanism, and drop pieces to write output data. In other words, it can make Tetris function like RAM.</p>

<p>To inhibit the player from contributing to calculations, it must play blindfolded. Input data, intermediate states, and output data must be inaccessible to the player. With that constraint, if the system composed of the player and the game processes information in the manor of a computer, then Tetris must be functioning as both RAM and a CPU.</p>

<h1 id="infinite-playfield">Infinite Playfield</h1>

<p>On an infinite playfield, completing a line requires infinite pieces and infinite time, neither of which the player can provide. Instead, the player deliberately grows the pile, building unbounded yet finite structures. And because lines are never cleared, the game always remains on the starting level (at the slowest drop speed).</p>

<p>Tetriminos spawn in column 0 at infinite height. Due to the nature of infinity, as a spawned piece falls, it never gets any closer to the floor regardless of the drop speed. In finite (though potentially vast) time, the player can shift the piece into any column. And once in position, it can hard drop to lock the piece into the surface of the pile.</p>

<p>The player can also perform a <span class="term">semihard drop</span>. It works like a hard drop, but instead of stopping when the piece can fall no further, it stops at a specified height. It is the only way to translate a piece from infinity to a finite distance above the floor.</p>

<h1 id="spawn-signal">Spawn Signal</h1>

<p>Since the player cannot see, the game signals when a spawn occurs. It reveals the randomly selected piece to the player, who responds with a timed sequence of requests to move it. If the playfield were empty, the game would satisfy every request and the player would know exactly where the piece is at any time. But the playfield is not empty. Existing pieces can interrupt a shift, as illustrated in the animation below; it shows where the blindfolded player expects a piece to be (left) and where it actually ends up (right).</p>

<object data="shift-interruption.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Shift Interruption</object>

<p>The same applies to gravity and soft drops:</p>

<object data="drop-interruption.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Drop Interruption</object>

<p>Since the spawn signal occurs after a piece locks, it could be abused to extract data out of the playfield, violating the concept of the blindfolded player. This is achieved by semihard dropping a piece into a column and observing how long it takes to lock, which is proportional to the height of the column. The entire surface of the pile could be probed.</p>

<p>To render such abuse ineffective, the method employees a version of Tetris that will not lock a piece until the player hard drops. The piece in play may rest indefinitely on a solid surface pending that explicit request to commit it to the pile.</p>

<h1 id="type-filtering">Type Filtering</h1>

<p>Building a structure logically-equivalent to a Boolean circuit requires placement of a specific sequence of Tetriminos. But the player cannot summon the pieces it needs into existence. Instead, it filters the provided pieces. When the randomizer spawns a piece that the player does not want, the player hard drops it onto an unbounded pile of discards in column &minus;2.</p>

<object data="discards-pile.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Discards Pile</object>

<p>Structures are made from the remaining pieces in columns &ge; 0. That infinite region&mdash;bounded on the bottom by the floor and on the left by the discards pile&mdash;serves as the workspace for building circuits.</p>

<h1 id="boolean-circuit-nodes">Boolean Circuit Nodes</h1>

<p>Nodes consist of pairs of vertically-adjacent cells. They can be in the following states.</p>

<object data="boolean-circuit-nodes.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Boolean Circuit Nodes</object>

<ul>
    <li><span class="mono">0</span> (false) &mdash; lower cell is solid, upper cell is empty.</li> 
    <li><span class="mono">1</span> (true) &mdash; upper cell is solid, lower cell is empty or solid.</li>  
    <li><span class="mono">?</span> (unassigned) &mdash; both cells are empty.</li>  
</ul>

<p>Nodes are composed of one or more pairs, all in the same state. Typically, a node is a contiguous, horizontal line of pairs, but not necessarily. The pairs of a node can be separated in space, even vertically separated. The image below shows one possible encoding of <span class="mono">01010</span>.</p>

<object data="encoding-01010.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">01010</object>

<p>The right-most bit is stored in a noncontiguous node.</p>

<h1 id="tetrisscript">TetrisScript</h1>

<p>The player builds structures by executing <span class="term">TetrisScript</span>, a language that specifies where to put the pieces. It only has 3 instructions. The first consists of a mnemonic and a column index:</p>

mnemonic x 

<p>It means:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Discard Tetriminos until the randomizer spawns the one specified by the mnemonic type.</li> 
    <li>Rotate the piece into the mnemonic orientation.</li>   
    <li>Shift the piece to column x.</li>   
    <li>Hard drop the piece to lock it into the pile.</li> 
</ol>

<p>The code below demonstrates this instruction type.</p>

<pre class="tetrisscript">
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
<span class="line">hello, world!</span>

<span class="line">hello, world!</span>
