<p class="title">Tetris is Turing-complete</p>  
<p>This article presents a method for embedding a programmable, general-purpose, digital computer into Tetris. The capabilities and performance of an implementation are demonstrated by running Tetris on Tetris.</p>

<h1 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h1>

<p>The <span class="term">playfield</span> is the grid of square cells where Tetris is played. The standard playfield has 20 visible rows and 10 columns, but the dimensions are arbitrary.</p>

<object data="standard-playfield.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Standard Playfield</object>

<p>Each playfield cell is in one of two states: empty or solid.</p>

<p><span class="term">Tetriminos</span>&mdash;the falling pieces&mdash;consist four solid cells painted any color. The seven Tetriminos have single-character, shape-based names.</p>

<object data="seven-tetriminos.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Seven Tetriminos</object>

<p>A <span class="term">rotation</span> system describes how Tetriminos rotate in relation to the surrounding cells and the playfield boundaries. The method employees the right-handed <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Nintendo_Rotation_System" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nintendo Rotation System</a> (NRS) due to its simplicity, but <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Category:Rotation_systems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">various rotation systems</a> exist and any of them could be adapted.</p>

<p>NRS centers each Tetrimino in a 5&times;5 matrix and rotates them 90&deg; about that center. Of the 24 possible orientations, it uses only 19.</p>

<object data="orientation-table.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="diagram">Orientation Table</object>

<p>The left-most column comprises the spawn orientations (the way the pieces initially appear). The steps of clockwise rotation span left-to-right.</p>

<p>The mnemonics above each orientation consist of the piece type concatenated with the first letter of &ldquo;down&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo;, &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;, &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;, or nothing for O.</p>

<p>A <span class="term">move</span> is a 90&deg; rotation or a 1-cell translation of the piece in play. The following terms apply to translation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <span class="term">shift</span> is a horizontal translation.</li>
  <li>A <span class="term">drop</span> is a downward translation.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A <span class="term">soft drop</span> is a player-controlled, 1-cell drop.</li>
    <li>A <span class="term">hard drop</span> is a meta-move that forces the piece as far down as it can go and <span class="term">locks</span> it into place. It is operationally-equivalent to repeated soft drops.</li>
    <li>A <span class="term">gravity drop</span> is an automatic, 1-cell drop triggered by the <span class="term">fall timer</span>.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>A move is preceded by a <span class="term">request to move</span>. Per NRS, the request is granted iff all four cells of the transformed Tetrimino are empty and are within the bounds of the playfield. If the fall timerâ€™s request for a gravity drop is denied, the piece locks and the next piece spawns.</p>

<p>Spawning involves a <span class="term">randomizer</span>, the mechanism that determines the sequence of pieces presented to the player. Any randomizer guaranteed to eventually produce all seven Tetriminos from any point in the sequence will work with the method.</p>
